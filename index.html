            Work-in-progress physics toy, written (mostly) from scratch.
            Personal project, with inspiration from <em><a href="https://handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a></em>.
        </p><p>
            My original intent with this project was to render a citrus fruit that could be siced by the user, revealing the intricate internal structure.
            At some point early on, I decided it would be cool to add simple physics.
        </p><p>
            Turns out "simple physics" is a deep rabbit hole, and has been the focus of the project since then.
            The current implementation is the most basic thing possible: impulse-based with no global constraint solver.
            Despite this, it's surprisingly stable, and without a concrete use-case to evaluate it against, I'm happy with where it stands as a jack-of-all.
        </p><p>
            I was also able to take advantage of the simple shape and implement many functions using geometry and analysis.
            Almost everything to do with the lemon is computed in closed-form; raycasting and inter-lemon collisions use much of the same reasoning, but require some iterative computations.
        </p><p>
            Moving forward, I'm looking to switch gears and focus on graphics.
            In particular, I want to experiment with non-photorealistic visual styles which are naturally suited to the uniform patterns of a lemon's surface and interior.

            Slapstick physics-based brawler where you can only control your legs.
            Group project for 300-level Video Game Design.
        </p><p>
            Based on a protoype by one of the other members, I was responsible for all of the non-UI code in the group's version.
            This included the physics-based gameplay, a variety of equippable shoes, with different abilities, customisable player costumes and colours, and juicy effects like screen-shake.
            As the person implementing the team's gameplay ideas, I also did most of the game's technical design and balance.

        </p><p>
            Snow and Iron was developed as part of a joint Computer Science and Media Design paper.
            As one of the Computer Science students on the team, I was responsible for programming the game's core systems.
            This included the unit AI, the game's rules and logical representation, and animating the units.

            Ethereal garden adventure with your friends.
            Group project for 200-level Software Engineering.
        </p><p>
            As a Software Engineering assignment, the game had to meet a set of specifications.
            Of these, I implemented the sprite-based renderer, netcode, and core game state model.
        </p><p>
            Looking back on this project, I'm slightly mortified by the (course-advocated) abuse of class hierachies in its implementation.
            But, I always thought the game's graphics managed a lot with a litle, and while there wasn't much gameplay to speak of, exploring the space and occaisionally bumping into your friends had a certain magic about it.
